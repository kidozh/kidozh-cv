## Experience

### __Intelligent manufacturing, Key Lab of Contemporary Design and Integrated Manufacturing Technology, Ministry of Education, NPU__  `2017.9 - `
_Intelligent manufacturing_<br>
- __Tool wear and Tool's remaining useful life prediction__, in single or multiple manufacturing mode, aims to monitor precise tool wear value by deep learning. Also, a transfer learning is used to migrate among different condition.
- __Deep learning model visualization__, aims to visualize deep learning (especially CNN) model for better understanding process, rules and principle of them in troubleshooting variety of problems in making part.
- __Tool wear forecasting__, the first deep learning model to accurately forecast tool wear in the future. And by RNN's extension, forecasting level gets raised.
- __Digital Twins By GAN__, the first deep conditional generative adversarial network to yield machining signal in given condition.

### __Peter the Great St.Petersburg Polytechnic University__  `2018.1 - 2018.2`
_Turbomachinery Winter Camp_<br>
__Turbomachinery__, in mechanical engineering, describes machines that transfer energy between a rotor and a fluid, including both turbines and compressors. While a turbine transfers energy from a fluid to a rotor, a compressor transfers energy from a rotor to a fluid.

### __Lightweighting Design, RWTH-Aachen__  `2014.9 - 2015.11`
_SLA_<br>
__bolts effects in composite material__, bolt's effect in bolted joint by ABAQUS is investigated. Hashin failure criteria is applied.

### __Dance Robot Inovation Club, NPU__  `2014.9 - 2015.11`
_Computer Vision in Software Department_<br>
__Computer Vision__, in basketball robot, aims to identify basketball and measure the distance from that. OpenCV, Point Cloud, Machine Learning and Deep Learning used. The robot won the 2nd prize at RoboCup Contest in 2015.

### __ACM Inovation Base__  `2014.7 - 2017.6`
_ACM/ICPC_<br>
__ACM__, Learns about fundamental and advanced computer algorithm and data structure. I won two prizes at Sichuan and Shaanxi ACM/ICPC provincial contest
